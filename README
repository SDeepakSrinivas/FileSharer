OverView and Working-->
	FileSharer is a command line software to help in file sharing through intranet. This is made possible with the help of sockets.
	Initially, The server is started primarily asking the user the directory he wants to share. Then the server waits for the connection at 
	port number 7227.At this time, a client may try to connect to the server on the same port. On connection, The client is shown the files and
	folders shared by the server.  then the client is supposed to input a set of commands as follows:
	
	Commands ::
--> To download a file, type "download <file name with extension>" 
--> To get into a directory further, type "open <folder name>" 
--> To go back a directory, type "back" 
--> To exit the software without downloading anything, type "exit" 
	
	Eg.
	download a.txt, open inFolder, back, exit
	
	The "download" command helps download a selected file from the server.
	The "open" command help open a certain directory shared by the server, i.e, to view the files in that directory
	The "back" command enables the user to go one directory backward in the server's shared folder.
	The "exit" command exits the software with a thanking message to both server and client.
	
	
Major advantage of FileSharer::-->
	Normally, file sharing softwares come differently for different operating systems. This is mainly due to the reason
	that path names are formatted differently in different operating systems. But, in FileSharer is a software which runs 
	both on the prominent Operating Systems Linux and Windows without problems. This is because initially, 
	FileSharer detects the Operating System of the user	by the getProperty() of System class. 
	And further this information is used for formatting the path String.
	Viewing the code will give a better outlook.
	
Modifications to expect in the FileSharer 2.0::-->

1.Download a directory on whole
2.Have two connections at once 
	(It was also attempted this time. But due to errors when two clients accessed the same file, we had to remove the facility. 
	Files shall be synchronized in the next version.)
3.A fully user friendly GUI



To Compile/Execute the program (in UBUNTU)-->

1. Extract the files to a desired directory. 
2. Open the terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T)
3.Open the desired directory using cd commands.
4. now type
	javac ServerSide.java
	javac ClientSide.java
This is to first compile the two classes which give us the .class files
5.Now Run the ServerSide class by typing
	java ServerSide
6. Now open a new terminal and do step 3.
7. Run the ClienSide class by typing
	java ClientSide
8. Now follow the instructions prompted by the program clearly as it runs.

NOTE::-->This software was developed on Eclipse IDE.
